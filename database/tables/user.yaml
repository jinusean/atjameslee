summary: I began my programming journey at the computer science department of Stony Brook University (New York). As a student, I learned to code starting with the fundamentals, including MIPS assembly, and Java. After finishing my studies at university, I taught myself to develop for the web, and worked as a full stack developer using tools such as Vue and Node. My most recent stint was as an AI Dev Intern at a startup in Bangkok that is bringing data-driven analytics to the food & beverage industry.
