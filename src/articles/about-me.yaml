I began my programming journey at the computer science department of Stony Brook University (New York).
As a student, I learned to code starting with the fundamentals, including MIPS assembly, and Java.
<br/><br/>
After finishing my studies at university, I taught myself to develop for the web,
and am currently employed as a full stack developer using tools, such as Vue and Node.
<br/><br/>
While I enjoy the satisfaction development gives me on a daily basis, I have set my next goal to become an expert
in machine learning, and have begun self-studying for this new endeaver.

An interest in ML was first obtained while working on my most recent personal project <a href="/projects/beauty-quotient">Beauty-Quotient</a>.
