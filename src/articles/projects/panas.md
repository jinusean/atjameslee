## Positive and Negative Affect Schedule ##

PANAS is a psychometric scale that measures a person's current state of mood based on 10 positive and 10 negative indicators. Each mood is scored from a 1 (very slightly) to 5 (extremely). The total score of positive and negative moods reveal the user's emotional state at the time of the survey, and demonstrates how an individual can have "mixed feelings."
