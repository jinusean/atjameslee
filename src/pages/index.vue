    <p class="about__description">
      I'm just a lowly fullstack developer who began his programming journey at the computer science department of State
      University of New York - Stony Brook Unversity.
      <br/>
      Nowadays I do web stuff, focusing on the front-end, but capable of writing RESTful services.
      <br/>
      In addition to programming, I've also completed courses in business and political science, and enjoy writing apps
      that relate to these disciplines.
