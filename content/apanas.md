## Positive and Negative Affect Schedule ##
<br/>
Developed by David Watson, Lee Anna Clark, and Auke Tellegen (1988) PANAS is a self-reporting tool that measures a person's current state of mood. There are a total of 10 positive and 10 negative moods that the user will rate, and the total score will reflect which mood is currently more dominant. The point of the scale is understand what the user is feeling at the time, and while it alone is not enough to reveal much about the individual, it can complement other data - such as productivity.

I developed this app using NativeScript, a framework that allowed me to create cross-platform mobile apps with Javascript. While the experience was not smooth as traditional Vue development, it was amazing to be able to create a working app within a few weeks even though I had zero mobile app development experience. Some of the difficulties I encountered was a small community of NativeScript-Vue developers, and limited functionality for data visualizations.

        Track your mood by selecting a rating for each of the 20 emotions. Emotions are displayed in random order for each session to eliminate any bias.

          The first step in improving your mental health is to be aware of what you are feeling. Analyze your previous moods for a given time-frame (daily, weekly, monthly). Understand which negative moods are influencing in your life, or check which positive moods need improvement.
