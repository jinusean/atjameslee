Swaychat is a service that allows site owners to chat with their visitors in real-time, and it was the first . 
<br /><br />
Chatting is something almost everyone in the world does today. From simple text messages, to high-octane A.I. chat-bots, the world could not function the way it does today without online messaging. The chance to develop one really gave me the chance to understand how this such an integral part of our lives works under the hood.

Some of the challanges faced while working on this project were:
1. &#8291;1. Transitioning from a monolithic architecture to an api fueled web app.
2. &#8291;2. Whether or not to use [Server Side Rendering](https://ssr.vuejs.org/) (SSR) or [Single Page App](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-page_application) (SPA) - decided to go with [Prerendering](https://medium.com/@gajus/pre-rendering-spa-for-seo-and-improved-perceived-page-loading-speed-47075aa16d24).
3. &#8291;3. How to queue new chat requests and how to delegate them to available agents.
4. &#8291;4. How to deal with a [Firebase's](https://firebase.google.com/) limitations/features.
